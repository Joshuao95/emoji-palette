* emoji_palette
This tool creates an illustration showing the combined colours of a number of emojis given on the commandline
** Motivation
Around November 2021, there was a TikTok trend to create palettes of colours from a given set of emoji.
This was usually accomplished using the blend tool in a paint program.
I thought it would be fun to automate it, learn a bit about how emojis are represented, and learn a bit about colour mixing.
** Usage
*** Preparing Emojis
Not shipped with this tool are the actual PNGs for creating the emoji palettes.
This is because I can't be bothered to work out the licences.
Instead, included is a python script which as of 2021-11-20 will scrape the emojis from the Unicode website.
*** Usage
It's a simple tool so I'll leave in depth stuff to ~--help~ here is an example though
: emoji-palette -p twitter -s 500 -r "emoji_scraper" üçë üçå ü¶´
Will output [[file:emoji_palette.png]]
** Colour mixing
Colour mixing doesn't appear to be a precise art, which makes sense considering human colour perception is not a precise sense.
Given that, I've gone for the simplest approach I could implement, which may very well not produce "nice" outputs, but again this was mostly for fun

The emoji are resolved to a single colour by simply resizing them to a 1x1 pixel using a standard flitering technique.
These colours are then blended by taking an average of the R/G/B values, which is a simple model.

I may revisit this and add alternate colour blending options, once I've researched it more
